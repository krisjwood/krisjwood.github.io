      <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
      <p>
        A learned skill of self awareness. It is an understanding and awareness of your own and others feelings and 
          emotions. And use them in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathise with others, 
          overcome challenges and defuse conflict. According to Daniel Goleman, there are five key elements:
        </p>
      <ul class="bullet-align">
          <li>
            <b>Self-awareness</b> - knowing how you feel, and you know how your emotions and your actions can affect the people 
              around you.
            </li>
          <li>
            <b>Self-regulation</b> - staying in control of your emotions and attitudes with other people
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Motivation</b> - working consistently toward goals, and have extremely high standards for the quality of your 
            work.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Empathy</b> - putting yourself in someone else's situation
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Social skills</b> - great communicator, open to hearing bad news just as much as good news and an expert at 
            getting people around them to support and be excited about a new mission or project.
          </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
      <img class="img-text-wrap" src="../images/IQ-EQ.png" alt="IQ and EQ"></p>
      <p>
        IQ is based on intelligence rather than emotion. It’s the ability to solve problems, use logic and gasp or 
          communicate complex ideas. IQ doesn’t necessarily account for the full range of thinking abilities, nor do they 
          predict success in school, work or life. IQ can be too narrow and does not encompass the full range of human 
          intelligence.
        </p> 
      
      <p>
        IQ = book smarts
      </p>
      <p>
        EQ = street smarts
      </p>
      <p>
        IQ is still recognised as an important element of success, particularly when it comes to academic achievement. 
          People with high IQs typically do well in school, often earn more money, and tend to be healthier in general.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
      <p>
        The world is a complex place and we humans have complex minds and emotions. If we can better manage our emotions 
          and relationships we are more likely to be able to better navigate the situations in our lives.
      </p> 
      <p>
        Some of the benefits of practicing EQ regularly include improved performance, leadership and happiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Daniel Goldman, one of the 'founders of the era of Emotional Intelligence' sites studies that find emotional 
          intelligence to be twice as important in one's work environment as IQ.
