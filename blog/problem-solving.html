        <h3>Once upon a time I had a problem...that I eventually solved</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Problem:</strong> Error on the last line of my code in the ‘Built In Methods’ code challenges. It was 
            saying the error was on the last line - line 46. All that line was doing was calling a function. The declaration 
            of the function was my job but the error was on the line calling it, which was written by EDA, which I hadn’t 
            touched. Weirdly the script ran fine the day before. 
        </p>
        <p><strong>Problem solving techniques:</strong> I tried a number of things and wasted about an hour. I knew it was 
            something small but couldn’t understand why it was saying an error on line 46 when the line of code seemed fine.
        </p>
        <p>
            I tried starting again with the code base as I thought I might have messed up some of the EDA code by accident. 
            I tried adding brackets, semi-colons…. and even a smiley face :-)
        </p>
        <p>
            I decided to take a break and have lunch. After returning from lunch I realised within 5 mins that the line with 
            the error was calling a function that I hadn’t closed with a curly bracket. So simple, so annoying!
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Emotions:</strong> I was feeling extremely frustrated with an error that shouldn’t even be an error! I started to believe the 
            computer was wrong and somehow Repl.it was broken.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>What I learned:</strong> If I’m stuck on something that seems unsolvable yet simple it’s probably because my brain is 
            fried and needs a break. Take regular breaks!
        </p>
        <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
        <p>
            This helps a lot as my mind usually runs straight to solving the big problem. Writing it out (by hand) helps me break it down.
        </p>

        <h3>Trying something</h3>
        <p>
            I do this a lot! Trial and error is my favourite way to get something to work, however I realised it’s probably the most time 
            consuming way of solving a problem. Saying that, I usually learn more doing it this way.
        </p>

        <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
        <p>
            Big fan! I have Woody from Toy Story on my desk (my nickname is Woody) who I talk to more than my partner! He’s a great listener 
            and never judgemental.
        </p>

        <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
        <p>
            I’m getting better at doing this as it’s usually the best clue to find the problem thus the solution. I used to just look at what 
            line the error was on and just try to figure it out but I’ve paid more attention to the actual message to help speed up debugging.
        </p>

        <h3>Console.logging</h3>
        <p>
            I use this a lot. My first draft of code is peppered with console.log. It’s a great window into what the computer is doing.
        </p>

        <h3>Googling</h3>
        <p>
            My best friend! I’ve always found the answers I need online and as a result have not reached out for help from anyone as I believe 
            if you can’t find the answer online then you’re probably not searching for the right thing. 
        </p>

        <h3>Asking your peers for help</h3>
        <p>
            Not needed to...yet!
        </p>

        <h3>Asking coaches for help</h3>
        <p>
            Not needed to...yet!
        </p>

        <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
        <p>
            My reflection time usually happens once I’ve finished my code and had a short break or the next morning. I find a fresh pair of eyes 
            extremely useful in cementing what I learned but also refactoring by code.
        </p>

            Thanks for reading :-)
