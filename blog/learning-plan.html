      <h2>My plan to learn.</h2>
      <h5>22nd April 2021 | Sprint 2</h5>

      <!-- Post content -->

        <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>I want to become familiar with lots of different technologies - various programming languages, 
          cyber security, machine learning, virtual reality, cloud and even quantum computing. I’d like to work 
          on diverse and broad projects that require many different elements and have a big impact on its intended 
          audience. I'm interested in being self employed again at some point but just waiting for the right idea!</p>
        
        <h3>Strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h3>
        <p>My strengths will help me with the learning experience as I am curious and adaptable, seeking out answers to 
          problems. However this can also mean I get distracted so may lose motivation or interest in particular tasks 
          before I complete them. I will be working on my limitations throughout the course.</p>

        <h3>Develop human skills</h3>
        <p>Although I have some experience working in teams, I want to strengthen my collaboration and communication skills
          giving me the ability to articulate myself to a group and solve problems collectively.</p>

        <h3>Workload commitment</h3>
        <p>I have cleared about 80% of my schedule for the duration of the course so I can dedicate the recommended time 
          to each day/week. I have weekends available if unforeseen circumstances arise during the week.</p> 

        <p>I have a good home office setup (dual monitor, powerful pc, comfy office chair) so I can be productive and not 
          get distracted.</p>
          
        <p>Each sprint starts on Sunday where I look over the upcoming sprint activities and plan the work into my week 
          around other commitments I may have. First thing on Monday I review what I completed the previous week and 
          make any changes that I missed. I split my day up into chunks to avoid long periods at my desk.</p> 
          
        <p>I find taking regular breaks is a great way to clear the mind and get some perspective if I’m getting 
          overwhelmed with a particular task. Having time away from work makes you more productive at work and I try 
          to use my breaks for something I enjoy doing. Taking time to exercise, spend time with the family and eating 
          delicious food is all beneficial for the mind and soul.</p>

        <h3>Seeking help commitment</h3>
        <p>I will always try resolve the problem myself first and maybe have a break and come back to it again. I will be 
          considerate of any deadlines and if I seek out help I’ll do it so that I give people enough time to be able 
          to help me without it impacting their workload too much.</p>

        <h3>Facilitation team expectation</h3>
        <p>My expectation is that they will keep me heading in the right direction on my learning journey and identity 
          any major issues that I may not notice myself. I'm terms of technical issues, I expect them to help me find the 
          solution but not actually provide the answer.</p>

        <h3>Scheduling information</h3>
        <p>I will need to collect my son from daycare occasionally which will mean I will need to leave bootcamp at 
          4:30pm. My partner has committed to doing the lions share during this course but she also has work commitments
          that can't be avoided.</p> 

        <p>I intend to plan these responsibilities in advance to make sure my workload or peers aren't affected.</p>  

        <p>Thanks for reading :-)</p>
