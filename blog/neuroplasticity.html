        <h3>Neuroplasticity</h3>
        <p>
          It is the process by which all permanent learning takes place in your brain. Exercising your brain has the 
          same effects as exercising your body. The more you practice something the better the brain will become at doing 
          or remembering the activity. Practice makes permanent.
        </p>
        <p>
          By knowing the science behind how neuroplasticity works, it allows people to adopt the best practices in order 
          to improve their abilities. And understanding that intelligence is malleable and not hardwired from birth, gives 
          people the motivation and opportunity to improve themselves through learning and practicing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Changing your brain through study and review is empowering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Summed up elegantly, Dr. Lara Boyd says "By learning new concepts, taking advantage of opportunities, and 
          participating in new activities, you are physically changing who you are, and opening up a world of endless 
          possibility."
        </p>

        <h3>How I will use neuroplasticity</h3>
        <p>
          I will use my imagination to think about the next activity. Visualising the steps I need to take will help me 
          understand the information better. I will continue to review and practice activities to help cement my learnings. 
          I will regularly revisit subjects that I feel under confident with in an attempt to build stronger pathways.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h3>
        <ul class="bullet-align">
            <li>
              Practice, practice, practice whatever you are trying to learn! Repetition is key.
            </li>
            <li>
              Exercise, mindfulness and sleep help prepare the brain in order to learn new things.
            </li>
            <li>
              Activities such as learning a new language, reading or playing a video game stimulate the areas of the 
              brain that benefit neuroplasticity.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Good TED Talk:</h3>

        <h3>Growth mindset</h3>
        <p>
          A growth mindset thrives on a challenge and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as a heartening 
          springboard for growth and for stretching our existing abilities. Adopting a growth mindset is having a belief 
          system that can be empowering, open you to new possibilities and allow you to reach your full potential.
        </p>
        <p>
          How important language is in believing in a growth mindset. ‘Not yet’ is more motivating that ‘fail’ and more 
          likely encourage the person to keep going.
        </p>
        <p>
          When (not if) I get stuck on something I will try to tell myself that I just don’t know the answer right now 
          but if I keep on trying I’ll get there. And I shouldn’t ever feel like I can’t do something. If I fail I will 
          treat it as a positive experience that I can learn from rather than a negative one.
        </p>
