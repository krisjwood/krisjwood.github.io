      <h1>CSS positioning</h1>

      <h2>I'm going to tell you all about the 5 ways to position elements in CSS.</h2>

      <!-- Post content -->
      <div>
        <h3>Static</h3>
        <p>This is the default position, unless stated HTML will assign this positioning to the element. 
          It follows the document flow of the HTML code. So the first element in the code will come first, 
          then the second etc.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Relative</h3>
        <p>Similar to static in that if follows the document flow, however top, right, bottom and left (TRBL) 
          properties are made available to move the element relative to its original position. The element’s 
          original position is anchored into the document flow but the element is technically removed from the 
          flow and therefore doesn’t impact the position of any surrounding elements. For this reason TRBL properties 
          are not commonly used with relative positioning as it may mean that other elements need to be moved to 
          avoid overlap. 
        </p>

        <h3>Absolute</h3>
        <p>Absolute positioning also has TRBL properties available to move the element - and it is recommended to use 
          these properties with this positioning style. Where relative positioning moves relative to itself, absolute 
          moves relative to its parent element. The parent element has to have a positioning value other than static 
          for it to work otherwise it will become relative to the html element.
        </p>

        <h3>Fixed</h3>
        <p>Similar to absolute positioning however it will always move relative to the html element i.e. the entire 
          page. As a result it is not affected by scrolling. It will stay in the same position on the screen.
        </p>


        <h3>Sticky</h3>
        <p>This one feels like a newer addition to CSS properties as its a love child of relative and fixed. It’s also 
          only compatible with about 90% of browsers which makes it sound newer than the others - use with caution! It 
          allows elements to behave dynamically when scrolling a page. 
          <br>
          The feature of this positioning style is that initially it is relative but when you scroll it will become 
          fixed when it reaches a TRBL value.
        </p>
