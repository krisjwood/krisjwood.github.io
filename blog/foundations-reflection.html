      <h3>What are three new things you have learned about yourself during core?</h3>
      <ol class="bullet-align">
        <li>
            Having done reflections like this in the past I felt I already knew myself fairly well but I’ve realised I’m a 
            different person to who I was in my 20s. The fact that we are always changing and adapting to our situation 
            and environment made me realise these things are a bit more fluid than fixed and should be given attention reguarly.
        </li>
        <li>
            How much I prioritise an optimistic outlook on life.
        </li>
        <li>
            The importance of taking breaks and doing things that are good for the mind and body like exercise, mindfullness eating good food and 
            spending time with family and friends. My work was dramatically better if I took regular breaks. Work smart, not hard. 
        </li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>The role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming</h3>
      <p>
        In learning, it helps you be open to the process and discover the ways learning works best for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        In programming, it’s important in order to work with others, deal with problems and produce things that have morale and 
        ethical considerations.
      </p>
      
      <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        How much of an emphasis there is on it. Coding is actually a smaller part of being a programmer than I first thought. 
        Thinking and acting like a programmer is more about collaborating with others to find solutions to problems.
      </p>

      <h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        Identifying the top values that most important to me.
      </p>
      <h3>Why does EDA spend so much time focusing on core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        Employers, especially in the tech industry, are increasingly looking for people who are the right fit for their culture and mission. 
        Knowing oneself helps sell yourself and increase the chances of employers seeing your and their values align. The ‘tech’ skills can 
        always be taught on the job. It’s very hard to teach someone values or identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Technically, anyone can learn some JS, HTML and CSS and say they are a programmer. But can they work with others, communicate 
        effectively and respect the beliefs, attitudes and behaviour of others while being self aware of your own strengths and limitations? 
      </p>
      <h3>Has core been a waste of time?</h3>
      <p>
        It hasn’t been a waste of time but it hasn’t been the most exciting part of foundations. Core was good because it shifted my mind 
        from tech for a bit and gave my brain a break from problem solving. It was also quite insightful but it took a lot of time and thinking 
        to get to a point I was happy that I’d completed the core material. Still not sure I fully understand who I am but that’s part of life’s 
        journey!
