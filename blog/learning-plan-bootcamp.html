        <h3>Long term goal and/or career pathway</h3>
        <p>
          Same as above. Web development is one area that I'm interested in. I believe being able to programme is an 
          important foundation to have for where I want be in the future. Long term I want experience in areas such as 
          cloud, AI and security to give me a broad understanding of the tech space. This will hopefully allow me to
          work on large scale projects, client facing opportunities or even to start my own business.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Strengths in Bootcamp</h3>
        <ul class="bullet-align">
          <li>I'm confident in my ability to take on new or unfamiliar situations. I'm comfortable being uncomfortable</li>
          <li>I generally pick things up pretty quick, especially when doing it hands on</li>
          <li>I have a thirst for knowledge and enjoy learning how things work and how to solve problems</li>
          <li>I like making things, whether it's bread, beer or tech to name a few.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Limitations in Bootcamp</h3>
        <ul class="bullet-align">
          <li>I lack focus on things that don't excite me or I don't believe in</li>
          <li>Sticking to routines is a challenge for me. I tend to get the job done but not in the way I planned.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp</h3>
        <p>Communicating my ideas so that my peers understand my perspective and can get onboard</p>
        
        <h3>Developing non-technical skills - human skills at Bootcamp</h3>
        <p>Working with others on technical challenges and problems. </p>
        
        <h3>Expectations from the Bootcamp team</h3>
        <p>
          Apart from one checkin, I haven't really engaged with my mentor during foundations as haven't really needed help. I've had the odd issue
          but managed to resolve it by myself. I feel going into Bootcamp I will have more interaction with the facilitators 
          as my technical knowledge will be tested more and the intensity of the course will no doubt have its ups and downs.
        </p>

        <h3>Expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
        <p>
          I want to get back in to the routine of Mon-Fri work as well as being in a office environment again. It's been a few years!
          I also want to develop my working with others skills in relation to programming. I'm use to working in teams but never worked
          with anyone else on programming. The pair programming is a bit intimidating but I think will be the most useful takeaway. 
        </p>

        <p>Thanks for reading :-)</p>
