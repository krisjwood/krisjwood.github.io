        <h3>Long term goal and/or career pathway</h3>
        <p>
          Same as during foundations. Web development is one area that I'm interested in. I believe being able to programme is an 
          important foundation to have for where I want be in the future. Long term I want experience in areas such as 
          cloud, AI, security as well as other languages to give me a broad understanding of the tech space. This will hopefully allow me to
          work on large scale projects with client-facing opportunities or even to start my own business.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Strengths in Bootcamp</h3>
        <ul class="bullet-align">
          <li>I'm confident in my ability to take on new or unfamiliar situations. I'm comfortable being uncomfortable</li>
          <li>I generally pick things up pretty quick, especially when doing it hands on</li>
          <li>I have a thirst for knowledge and enjoy learning how things work and how to solve problems</li>
          <li>I like making things, whether it's bread, beer or tech to name a few.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Limitations in Bootcamp</h3>
        <ul class="bullet-align">
          <li>I lack focus on things that don't excite me or I don't believe in</li>
          <li>Sticking to routines is a challenge for me. I tend to get the job done but not in the way I planned, which isn't good when
            working in teams.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp</h3>
        <p>
          I lean more towards being an introvert in terms of where I get my energy from (working in small groups or on my own).
          Solving problems and working on projects with others will be something I'll need to work on and get use to.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Developing non-technical skills - human skills at Bootcamp</h3>
        <p>Working in teams to solve problems collectively.</p>
        
        <h3>Expectations from the Bootcamp team</h3>
        <p>
          Bootcamp is going to be intense and fast paced. I believe they will create an environment similar to the real world where nobody is 
          holding your hand or telling you the answer. They will expect us to exhaust all other avenues before reaching out for help. I expect
          them to ask questions not give answers to help develop our problem solving ability.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, there is going to be situations where individually or as a group, progress has halted. To ensure we don't waste time on one area 
          I'd hope they would assist and provide knowledge on how to get back on track.  
        </p>

        <h3>Expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
        <p>
          My expectation is to be out of my comfort zone all day, with the hope that the zone will become more comfortable in time.    
        </p>
        <p>I intend to listen, be patient and learn from my peers.</p>

        <p>My commitment to myself is that I turn up each day with a hunger to learn, energy to get involved and open mind to what is asked of me.</p>

        <p>Thanks for reading :-)</p>
